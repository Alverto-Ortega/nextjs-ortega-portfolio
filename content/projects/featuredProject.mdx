## Featured Project 

Customizing a pre-built Next.js template with Vercel and Upstash Redis still allows you to demonstrate a variety of skills. Here’s a revised list that focuses on the customization aspect:

Code Customization: Ability to modify and extend existing code to fit personal style and functionality.
Understanding Frameworks: Gained insights into how Next.js operates and how components interact.
Styling: Applied CSS or other styling methods to alter the appearance according to your design preferences.
API Interaction: Worked with API routes to handle data fetching and manipulation.
Serverless Functions: Modified or created new serverless functions to add or change functionality.
Database Operations: Performed CRUD operations with Upstash Redis to manage application data.
Performance Tuning: Optimized the application’s performance by tweaking the pre-built template.
Debugging: Identified and resolved issues within the existing codebase.
Version Control: Managed changes and updates using Git.
Deployment: Deployed the customized application using Vercel’s platform.
