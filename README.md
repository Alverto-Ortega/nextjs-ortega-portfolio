    <h1>Alverto Ortega's Portfolio - Nextjs Web Site</h1>
    <h3>Sorry, page is currently under construction. Updating soon!<3</h3>

My personal portfolio website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Upstash](https://upstash.com?ref=chronark.com), [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Running Locally


```sh-session
git clone https://github.com/Alverto-Ortega/nextjs-ortega-portfolio.git
cd nextjs-portfolio
```


Create a `.env` file for your environment variables of your API's, etc., similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com/blob/main/.env.example). Common practice is `.env.local`

Then install dependencies and run the development server:
```sh-session
npm install
npm run dev
```


## Cloning / Forking

Please remove all of my personal information (projects, images, etc.) before deploying your own version of this site.
